                    The common room is located in Staircase 8 (first room to the left when entering). Entry is via swipe-card access. It also has a small kitchen with tea and coffee, several computers, wireless internet access, a piano, a bathroom, a tutorial room, some lockers and the newspapers and periodicals which are delivered there every morning every day of the week. <br><br>The direction of the MCR is provided by the Executive Committee, who are elected every year in the first week of Hilary Term. For people new to the MCR, or generally, to Oxford and Exeter College, we have a fresher’s guide, which will hopefully answer your questions about how things are done here. The graduate welfare reps are there to take care and assist you with any problems that might arise during your stay here. Certain people can apply for associate membership of the MCR, which gives them access to the MCR facilities.</p>

I have experienced nothing but kindness and generosity on all fronts, from my fellow graduate students to the JCR, scouts, kitchen staff, fellows and porters. Compared to other colleges, our MCR is a lovely size where there are still plenty of people to meet, but a comforting sense of closeness amongst the members. We have forged a great number of ties with other graduate common rooms across Oxford, resulting in many joint social and welfare events.

                        <br>From the Big Gay Party to names for some of the appliances, Exeter continues to have an MCR with idiosyncrasies only possible from it having a spirited graduate body often around College.

I distribute information on university-wide LGBTQ+ events and LGBTQ+ events happening within Exeter College.
                        <br>I also work closely with the Welfare Officers to organise and run regular events aiming at promoting equality in the MCR, such as the consent workshops. Additionally, we provide various welfare supplies including sexual health products and sanitary products confidentially and completely free of charge to members of the MCR.
                        <br>My job and interest is to both represent and offer independent support or advice on equality issues. All enquiries are kept in the strictest confidence – please feel free to contact me.
